# Smart Waste Management System (SWMS)

A comprehensive IoT-based solution for optimizing urban waste collection, citizen participation, and sustainable living. SWMS automates bin monitoring, collection planning, and engages users with eco-friendly features to promote recycling and reduce waste.

---

## Key Features

### 1 **Real-time Bin Monitoring**

* **What it does:**
  Uses IoT sensors (Ultrasonic/IR) installed in waste bins to measure fill levels.
* **How it works:**
  Sensor data is sent via **MQTT** or **REST API** to the backend ‚Üí stored in **MongoDB** ‚Üí displayed on the **dashboard in real-time**.
* **Purpose:**
  Helps authorities monitor bin status live & prioritize collections.

---

### 2 **Optimized Route Planning**

* **What it does:**
  Calculates the most efficient route for waste collection vehicles.
* **How it works:**
  Uses bin fill-level data + location ‚Üí applies **AI/graph algorithms (Dijkstra/A*)*\* ‚Üí generates optimized route map.
* **Purpose:**
  Saves fuel, reduces time & manpower for waste collection.

---

### 3 **Automated Collection Alerts**

* **What it does:**
  Notifies officials when a bin reaches its capacity threshold.
* **How it works:**
  Backend checks bin data periodically ‚Üí if fill % > threshold ‚Üí sends alert via dashboard/notifications.
* **Purpose:**
  Avoids overflow, ensures timely collection.

---

### 4 **Data Analytics Dashboard**

* **What it does:**
  Provides visual insights on waste management metrics.
* **How it works:**
  Aggregates historical bin data ‚Üí displays in charts/graphs using **Chart.js** ‚Üí shows trends, predictions.
* **Purpose:**
  Helps decision-makers analyze performance & plan strategies.

---

### 5 **User & Admin Panels**

* **What it does:**
  Different dashboards for citizens, collectors, and city officials.
* **How it works:**
  Role-based authentication ‚Üí Admin can manage bins, users ‚Üí Citizens can view bin status, sell recyclables.
* **Purpose:**
  Separates functionalities as per user roles.

---

### 6 **Nearby Recycling Centers**

* **What it does:**
  Shows users the closest recycling centers or drop-off points.
* **How it works:**
  Uses **Google Maps API** to fetch and display center locations ‚Üí filters based on user‚Äôs geolocation.
* **Purpose:**
  Makes it easier for citizens to find and reach recycling points nearby.

---

### 7 **Eco-Commerce**

* **What it does:**
  Provides a marketplace for eco-friendly and sustainable products.
* **How it works:**
  Lists curated products from vendors ‚Üí users can browse & buy ‚Üí optional integration with payment gateways.
* **Purpose:**
  Promotes green shopping habits among users.

---

### 8 **Eco-Chatbot**

* **What it does:**
  Interactive chatbot that answers queries about recycling and app features.
* **How it works:**
  Frontend chat UI ‚Üí connects to a chatbot API (e.g., Rasa/Dialogflow) ‚Üí fetches responses.
* **Purpose:**
  Educates users and provides instant support on eco-friendly practices.

---

### 9 **Gamified Learning & Quizzes**

* **What it does:**
  Makes learning about waste management fun and interactive.
* **How it works:**
  Provides short learning modules/videos ‚Üí quizzes after each module ‚Üí awards badges on completion.
* **Purpose:**
  Boosts user engagement & eco-awareness through gamification.

---

### 10 **Sell Recyclables**

* **What it does:**
  Allows citizens to sell sorted recyclables to local collectors.
* **How it works:**
  Users fill a form (type, weight, location) ‚Üí request is sent to backend ‚Üí connects to nearest collectors.
* **Purpose:**
  Encourages recycling by offering monetary benefits.

---

### 11 **Waste Classifier (AI)**

* **What it does:**
  Classifies waste types from uploaded images & gives recycling suggestions.
* **How it works:**
  User uploads image ‚Üí AI model (CNN-based) processes it ‚Üí predicts category (plastic, organic, metal, etc.) ‚Üí shows recycling tips.
* **Purpose:**
  Helps users sort their waste correctly using AI assistance.
